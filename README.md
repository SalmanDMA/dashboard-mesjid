# Dashboard Mesjid

## Description

The Admin Page serves as the central component of this project. It acts as a secure entry point, requiring authentication before allowing access to essential CRUD operations. These CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are meticulously designed to provide comprehensive control over event and sermon schedule management, which will later be presented to users.

The interface design of the Admin Page focuses on user-friendliness and quick comprehension. An intuitive user experience and a streamlined layout are crafted to ensure smooth accessibility, even for those who are less experienced with technology.

This page offers you the capability to efficiently manage events and sermon schedules. Each CRUD operation is presented through a structured and user-friendly interface. From here, you can seamlessly add, view, edit, and delete events and sermon schedules with guided and straightforward steps.

We believe that the combined visual appeal and functionality of this project will provide an effective and user-friendly solution for efficiently managing events and sermon schedules.
